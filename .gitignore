# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is
#   intended to run in multiple environments; otherwise, check them in:
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having platform-specific dependencies or dependencies
#   having no cross-platform support, pipenv may install dependencies that don't work, or not
#   install all needed dependencies.
#Pipfile.lock

# UV
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include uv.lock in version control.
#   This is especially recommended for binary packages to ensure reproducibility, and is more
#   commonly ignored for libraries.
#uv.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include poetry.lock in version control.

# pdm
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pdm.lock in version control.
#   pdm recommends including project-wide configuration in pdm.toml, but excluding .pdm-python.

# pixi
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally recommended to include pixi.lock in version control.
#pixi.lock
#   Pixi creates a virtual environment in the .pixi directory, just like venv module creates one
#   in the .venv directory. It is recommended not to include this directory in version control.

# Summary: ML/DL workflow for Time Series
A typical ML/DL-for-TS workflow
Problem framing: 
Pick the granularity (hourly, daily…).
Decide the forecast horizon (next 24 h, next 12 weeks…).
Choose the business metric you will optimise (MAE/MAPE for demand, service-level for inventory).
Feature engineering
For classical ML models (trees, linear, SVR)
Lag columns: t – 1, t – s, t – 2s, rolling means/stds.
Calendar flags: weekday dummies, month, holiday binary.
External regressors: weather, promo flag, web traffic.
Target transforms (log, Box-Cox) if Gaussian noise is assumed. This is needed for linear regression, SVR, kNN. Not for tree based algorithms.
For DL models (such as RNN/LSTM)
Often no need for lag & rolling features:  sequence models see raw history.
Categorical IDs → embeddings (shop_id, item_id).
Normalise/standardise each continuous channel; leave binaries as 0/1.
Known-future features (price calendar, promo schedule).
Train / validation split
Time-based only – no shuffling.
Classical ML: expanding window or walk-forward back-test.
Expanding-window back-test: start with the first N observations, train → test on the next block; then enlarge the window and repeat.
Walk-forward (a stricter variant) re-fits the model at every step—good for small datasets.
DL: use early-stopping or a rolling validation set; ensure batches respect chronological order.
Early-stopping split: reserve the last 10–20 % of the series as a validation block; stop training when that error stops improving.
Rolling validation: if you want multiple DL re-trains.
Model selection & tuning
ML: 
Choose a small grid or use Bayesian search over for different parameters. For example: tree depth.
Evaluate each config with the expanding-window test from Step 3.
Pick the lowest MAE/MAPE and simplest model that meets business targets.
DL:
Tune architecture: number of layers, hidden units, dropout, attention heads.
Tune optimiser schedule: learning rate, batch size, epochs.
Use validation loss for early stopping; if multiple configs converge, rank by hold-out MAE/MAPE.
Residual diagnostics
Check whether residuals still show autocorrelation or seasonality; if so, add lags or seasonal dummies.
Deployment & monitoring
Automate retraining, track live error drift, set alarms for regime changes.
 
📌
If your series are short, clean, and low-noise, start with classical ARIMA/SARIMA. Otherwise, an ML approach—starting with boosted trees and moving toward deep-learning—often unlocks lower error and richer insights.
